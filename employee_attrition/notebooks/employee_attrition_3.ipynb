In this case, this mostly applies to people who are working overtime and who in many cases have a relatively low salary - it **should be checked whether there is an effective overtime policy in our company**;\n\n•\tOur simple decision tree shows that further solutions may not lie uniquely in people getting higher salaries (or their overtime pay). Those with relatively higher salaries may be interested in something more than just a paycheck, and might still leave if they do not feel part of the company (e.g. if they don't have any stock options, or if they don't have access to trainings);\n\n•\tWe have also found that different facets of **work-life balance** might represent an issue for our employees (a finding supported by visualizations and (at least to some extent) our best algorithm). One of the things that **should be checked is e.g. whether there is a lack of certain teleworking arrangements in our company**;\n\n•\tThere seems to be a link between attrition and age as well as the number of companies worked for. At this point, we cannot provide more information and it would be necessary to delve deeper into our dataset, e.g. to ascertain whether this is not simply linked to retirements or to see whether there is an unfair treatment of certain age groups and whether specific part of our workforce is in need of an intervention (e.g. more job security, upskilling, etc.).\n\n•\tIf we take our \"test\" set as an example of IBM's current workforce, we can say that the **job role with highest probability of attrition is sales representative** - something should be definitely done about that, and we could explore further what exactly.\n\nLast but not least, if we would be given a new dataset of our employees, we could calculate probabilities and see which employees exactly are prone to leaving - with an **algorithm that outperformed standard algorithms (e.g. Random Forest)!**\n\nI'll leave this kernel here for the moment, you're more than welcome with any suggestion on how to improve it, or if you wish, feel free of course to fork it and develop these analyses a bit further!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bf433234f9833181a40a51444392fddb73e8c358","_cell_guid":"4d65e080-ffbe-4399-b32f-7b03aef15a7e","_execution_state":"idle"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## A quick EDA ##"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"69483683e5c0087caf02385a21ce73fccdbb8628","_cell_guid":"b778415c-70a6-483b-a16d-84c986ef08d3","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"ibm <- read.csv(\"../input/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv\")\n\nsuppressMessages(library(ggplot2))\nsuppressMessages(library(grid))\nsuppressMessages(library(gridExtra))\nsuppressMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressMessages(library(rpart))\nsuppressMessages(library(rpart.plot))\nsuppressMessages(library(randomForest))\nsuppressMessages(library(caret))\nsuppressMessages(library(gbm))\nsuppressMessages(library(survival))\nsuppressMessages(library(pROC))\nsuppressMessages(library(DMwR))\nsuppressMessages(library(scales))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e0cbf945c5d2290ffb263b0ad3b28398273d116","_cell_guid":"59c56d65-a9c6-4c28-bfdd-603a9fc55384","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"g1 <- ggplot(ibm, \n            aes(x = MonthlyIncome, fill = Attrition)) + \n            geom_density(alpha = 0.7) + \n            scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#386cb0\",\"#fdb462\"))\n\ng2 <- ggplot(ibm, \n            aes(x = HourlyRate, fill = Attrition)) + \n            geom_density(alpha = 0.7) + \n            scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#386cb0\",\"#fdb462\"))\n\ng3 <- ggplot(ibm, \n            aes(x = DailyRate, fill = Attrition)) + \n            geom_density(alpha = 0.7) + \n            scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#386cb0\",\"#fdb462\"))\n\ng4 <- ggplot(ibm, \n            aes(x = MonthlyRate, fill = Attrition)) + \n            geom_density(alpha = 0.7) + \n            scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#386cb0\",\"#fdb462\"))\n\ngrid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, g4, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fbb294ca74b4a0d6ec93d98a38352ec69c8964a1","_cell_guid":"f5ad1bf2-a6cd-4cff-8011-e00096b722b7","_execution_state":"idle"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well, since it is a simulated dataset (a pity!) we do not have any real clue about e.g. the difference in income and rate.

This is an interesting issue, since a high correlation between these two variables (longer you are in the company, less chance you have to be promoted, so to speak) may mean that people are not really growing within the company. However, since this is a simulated dataset we cannot compare it with some norms outside it, so we can compare certain groups within our set, e.g. those who are working overtime and those who are not. \n\nHere we can note two things. Firstly, there is a relatively higher percentage of people working overtime in the group of those who left, an observation confirmed by our barchart. Secondly, while things seem to be going in the right direction for the group of people who still work for the IBM (higher correlation between years since last promotion and years at company for those who don't work overtime), the opposite is happening in the other group. It seems that there may be a pattern of people leaving because they are not promoted although they work hard. This is only an assumption at this point, since the confidence intervals (gray area around the lines) are getting wider, meaning there is not that much certainty about this, especially at higher values of X and Y (due to the lack of data).

We can see that its specificity is a bit lower (12% to 16%), but this seems reasonable since we have a **40%-55% gain in sensitivity (72.5%)!** It is really doing far better if we compare it to the sensitivity of RF (15.9%), GBM (18.8%) or decision tree (33%).\n\nThis is the reason why I prefer AUC to e.g. accuracy. The latter can be - especially in the case of class imbalance - inflated by the fact that our model has a high specificity (correctly identifying the negatives), but we cannot really generalise and extrapolate anything from such a model (e.g. it may be quite misleading to say that \"low income\" is the reason behind people resigning, if we only see that people who stay have higher income and there is no pattern in those who leave). Moreover, we may not be able to find out which - if any - department or job role is at risk, since our information (predictions) about employees at risk is really scarce - meaning we would also be having difficulties addressing them individually in case we would want to do so.

Complex algorithms aren't easy to interpret, but there are several ways in which they can be useful: \n\n - We can examine the variable importance list, and see which factors in general are helpful in determining the outcome (e.g. attrition); this can be also useful in determining where should we carry out our (HR) audit first, \n - We can use our model to calculate the probabilities of leaving for each and everyone of e.g. our new employees; we can also make new variables from these probabilities, e.g. determining who one has the highest possibility to leave and has at the same time high performance rating, works several hours, and contributes in a meaningful way to our company .. We can then convey this information to our management who can perhaps assess the situation, and speak to the person in a tactful way, \n - We can evaluate our organisational tree with regards to these probabilities; e.g. we can assess which department or role has the highest possibility of leaving, and then channel our efforts there, or do additional analyses on that department/role (either quantitative or e.g. focus groups). \n\nLet us plot the variable importance list from our best model.
